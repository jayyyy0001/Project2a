			<div class="part4a"><p> Hello, I am Jaylin Henderson, and I am the creator of this campaign. I made this campaign to raise awareness to the issues these young girls face when it comes to child prostitution. I do this because I am a teenage girl and these issues involve people my age. I have done much research on the ways these youngs are treated, and how these pimps see them. It has brought me to realize I need to help these girls in anyway possible. My mission is to not enlightenment people about this issue, but getting people to help these girls more. High school teachers, parents, friends, everyone should be able to know the signs of child prostitution and how they can be saved.</p></div>
