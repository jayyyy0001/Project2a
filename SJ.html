		<div class="part4g"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2NTE3MTYyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI5NTUyMQ@@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg"><p> The main social justice with child is that pimps degrade these young girls. They treat them as if they are just property with no feelings. Many pimps will manipulate a girl by using there vulnerability, either these girls have been abused at home, want attention, or poverty. Pimps pray on these girls weaknesses hoping they can take them into their grasp. It's easier for a pimp to manipulate a young girl because there age makes them weaker than what they were before. Pimps also abuse these young girls, beating until they are broken down enough to crawl back to their pimps when the pimp calls for them. When inside child prostitution many of these girls are dehumanized.</p></div>

This is because on the media and even in life prostitutes are seen as these nasty girls that put themselves in these issues. They are shamed and frowned upon. Not only that, but the media and movies make prostitution seem like a great luxurious life with all the money in the world, without discussing the behind the scenes issue. The other issue is that the media will show pimps are people who portray pimps, but the media won't help real prostitutes. Another issue is that songs, or music videos will be released that show guys control over woman, how all girls are hoes, and etc. Many people make music like this because they see how much money is being made when it comes to what the media feeds into and gives attention to.</p></div>
