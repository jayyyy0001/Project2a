		<div class="part4e"><p> After going through my website I hope you have been able to learn the risk these young girls face. They are being abused very poorly and we need to make a change. Here's the things you could do.</p></div>
		<div class="part5e"><img src="https://screening.mhanational.org/sites/default/files/2018-01/Community_0.png"><h2>Signs</h2><p>Many of these young girls can show signs of child prostitution, it never hurts to ask.</p><ul>
																																																									<li>Constant running away</li>

																																																									<li>Physical abuse</li>
																																																									<li>Change in attitude</li>
																																																									<li>Signs of fear over someone</li>
																																																								</ul>

		<div class="part6e"><img src="https://au.reachout.com/-/media/young-people/images/legacy-articles/girl-consoling-her-friend.jpg"><h2>Support</h2><p>These young girls need support from friends, family, etc. That's all they look for when it comes down to these situations. They need someone to lean on and someone to tell them this will get easier. There has been so many cases where these girls have tried to go back to their normal life, but no one is ever there for them. Mainly for teenagers because kids will focus on image more than trying to help. Many cases has happened where girls will say,"I'm sorry I can't hang out with you, people will think I'm a hoe." For other people including parents, if they come back to you not only convince them to stay, but don't look at them differently. That will trigger these girls into going back to the streets.</p></div>
