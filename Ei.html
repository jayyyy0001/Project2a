Instead it effects the environment for young girls as well as the environments on the streets at night. Girls have to be careful who they can befriend as well as worries about being kidnapped. Prostitution will usually start with runaways which deals with girls on the streets alone being manipulated into prostitution. It also deals with the unsafe environment these girl will go through when they are in prostiution. From evil customers, who will abuse the girls to the ruthless pimps. The streets that these young girls call home aren't safe at all. Another environmental issue is the sex market itself. This is because youbg girls are very profitable, and with the increase in technology these young girls are being traded all across the country to different pimps. This also feeds into sex tourism which involves people traveling just for the prostitution, this is very common in Las Vegas.</p></div>
